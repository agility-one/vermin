vermin cp <source> <destination>

where: <source> and <destination> take the form of <vm_name>:/path/to/file/or/directory
In case of the <source> or <destination> is the local host, then the "<vm_name>:" part is removed.

Note: You need to have appropriate permissions on the files you need to copy.

Copy file.txt from host to user's home directory inside the vm
$ vermin cp ~/file.txt vm_01:~ 

Copy file.txt from user's home directory inside the vm to the current directory on the host
$ vermin cp vm_01:project/file.txt . 

Copy /etc/os-release from the inside the vm to ~/temp on the host
$ vermin cp vm_02:/etc/os-release ~/temp

Copy file.txt from vm_01 home dir to the vm_02 /tmp dir
$ vermin cp vm_01:~/file.txt vm_02:/tmp

	// Here you will define your flags and configuration settings.

	// Cobra supports Persistent Flags which will work for this command
	// and all subcommands, e.g.:
	// cpCmd.PersistentFlags().String("foo", "", "A help for foo")

	// Cobra supports local flags which will only run when this command
	// is called directly, e.g.:
	//cpCmd.Flags().StringP("local", "l", "", "Local file/folder to copy to VM home directory")
	//cpCmd.Flags().StringP("remote", "r", "", "VM file/folder to copy to host at current directory")
